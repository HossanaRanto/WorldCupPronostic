# WorldCupPronostic
Make a prediction for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. A prediction on Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 using random numbers but while respecting FIFA standards.

The prognosis.js file is the project module. It is responsible for processing the data (Backend if we can say so) The main.js file is responsible for linking the pronostic.html and pronostic.js files (integration)

It is important to launch the application under a server otherwise the prognosis.js module will not work
